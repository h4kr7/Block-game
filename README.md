# 8 Bit Game using pygame
**Develop a simple game using the following guidelines:-**
1. The player can only move vertically.
2. In addition to the player block, there will be two other blocks.
3. One will be a scoring block, and the other will be an opposition block.
4. As soon as the player collides with an enemy block, the game ends. If the player collides with a scoring block, the score increases, and all scoring blocks are necessary.
